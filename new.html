            <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>
            <p>I was born in CA, I have lived in 21 different countries and 3 different states. I currently live in TN,
                about 50 minutes outside of Nashville. I originally went to school to become a Respiratory Care
                Practitioner. I worked in the ER, Trauma, ICU and burn unit for 10+ years. Basically, if your were
                coding(not what we are doing), I was there! </p>
            <img src="/images/Gracewalk.jpeg" id="Grace_walk" alt="Walking away with dogs">
            <p>I decided to get out of the medical field and I almost became a web developer 7 years ago, but chose to
                start my business instead. I started my first business called<a
                    href="https://www.luckydogsanfrancisco.com/">Lucky Dog</a>about 7 years ago. I sold that business to
                buy a home here in TN. I've been dog training, boarding and walking ever since. </p>
            <p>When I am not working you will find me outside exploring, hiking, paddleboarding, camping. If the weather
                is terrible and I do mean terrible then I will be inside playing games, playing piano, writing or
                cuddling with my boyfriend and pups.</p>
            <p>I got into coding 7 year ago and did some html, css and javascript courses on Kahn Academy. I was very
                fascinated with it and intended to continue learning it, but my business took off. Now, with my new
                business, I mainly do the dog training and administrative work so I have time to focus on becoming a web
                developer.</p>
