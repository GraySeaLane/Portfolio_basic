            <h2>Hello and welcome!</h2>
            <p>I am origianlly from CA, but have traveled a lot in my life. I have lived in 21 different countries and 3 different states. My parents were missionaries in Africa and Europe growing up. I currently live in TN with my boyfriend,
                about 50 minutes outside of Nashville. I went to college to become a Respiratory Care
                Practitioner. I worked in the Trauma, ICU and burn unit for 10+ years. Basically, if you were
                coding(not what we are doing), I was there! </p>
            <img src="/images/Gracewalk.jpeg" id="Grace_walk" alt="Walking away with dogs">
            <p>I decided to get out of the medical field about 7 years ago and I almost became a web developer at that time. I learned basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript. but I chose to
                start my first business instead. I started <a
                    href="https://www.luckydogsanfrancisco.com/">Lucky Dog</a>, I loved it and it did well. I recently sold that business to
                buy a home here in TN. I started another business here, I've been dog training and boarding ever since. Check out my current business <a
                href="https://www.luckypawstn.com/">Lucky Paws. I also am studying yoga so that I can teach dog yoga classes.</a> </p>
            <p>When I am not working you will find me outside exploring, hiking, paddleboarding, camping, biking, swimming or playing with my pups. If the weather
                is terrible and I do mean terrible then I will be inside playing games, playing piano, doing yoga, writing, making skin products or
                cuddling with my boyfriend and pups. I also enjoy traveling and music of all kinds. </p>
            <p>I want to become a web developer to improve my business and to grow my career. My goal longterm is to find a remote job where I can be both a web developer and continue my business of dog training and boarding.</p>
